Troubleshooting program for GCSE A453.
Please don't copy; It'll either be awful or good, but it'll still get you done for cheating.
## Task 1
Task 1
When a customer has a problem with a product, automated troubleshooting programs are available to
help them.
If a problem with a mobile device occurs, then a troubleshooting process is invoked, with the user
responding to a series of questions that lead to a solution or advice to contact the supplier directly.
For example, a conversation might proceed as follows:

> System: ‘Has the phone got wet?’

> User: ‘No’

> System: ‘Has the phone been dropped?’

> User: ‘No’

> System: ‘Is the phone fully charged?’

> …

Not all of the questions need to have yes or no responses but each response will need to lead to a
supplementary question or a solution.
Analyse the requirements for this system and design, develop, test and evaluate a program to
interrogate the user about the nature of the device and the problem, leading to a solution or advice to
call the supplier. You will need to create a suitable troubleshooting tree for a mobile device. This should
be a demonstration version of the system with at least 10 possible outcomes, but need not include an
exhaustive list of potential problems or outcomes.

## Task 2
Task 2
Some automated troubleshooting programs identify certain keywords in the customer’s query to provide
potential solutions to the query.
For example, ‘There is no display on my mobile phone screen.’
The keywords ‘display’ and ‘phone’ would link to common problems with a phone display.
Analyse the requirements for this system and design, develop, test and evaluate a program to identify
keywords in a query typed in by the user and provide a linked solution to common problems related to
a mobile device from a selection stored in a text file or database. You will need to identify appropriate
keywords that can be linked to general advice related problems. You need to account for variations in
the form of the user input e.g. one user may query ‘There is no display on my mobile phone’, another
user may query ‘My phone screen is blank.’
