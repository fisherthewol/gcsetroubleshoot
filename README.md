Troubleshooting program for GCSE A453.
Please don't copy; It'll either be awful or good, but it'll still get you done for cheating.
## Task 1
Task 1
When a customer has a problem with a product, automated troubleshooting programs are available to
help them.
If a problem with a mobile device occurs, then a troubleshooting process is invoked, with the user
responding to a series of questions that lead to a solution or advice to contact the supplier directly.
For example, a conversation might proceed as follows:

> System: ‘Has the phone got wet?’
> User: ‘No’
> System: ‘Has the phone been dropped?’
> User: ‘No’
> System: ‘Is the phone fully charged?’
> …

Not all of the questions need to have yes or no responses but each response will need to lead to a
supplementary question or a solution.
Analyse the requirements for this system and design, develop, test and evaluate a program to
interrogate the user about the nature of the device and the problem, leading to a solution or advice to
call the supplier. You will need to create a suitable troubleshooting tree for a mobile device. This should
be a demonstration version of the system with at least 10 possible outcomes, but need not include an
exhaustive list of potential problems or outcomes.
